Project Name: Event Planner for Friends

Description of the problem that this application will solve:
Coordinating informal events in friend groups often leads to inefficiencies due to fragmented 
communication, lack of task delegation, and difficulty in tracking event details. Traditional event 
management applications like Eventbrite are designed for large-scale public events and don't cater 
to the specific needs of small, private gatherings. As a result, users rely on group chats, google 
docs, and separate apps to manage RSVPs, assign responsibilities, and communicate updates, which can 
lead to miscommunication and disorganization.
This app would allow all aspects of event planning to be centralized on one platform. Users would be
able to see time, location, itinerary, outstanding tasks, send out notificaitions when changes are 
made, etc.

Primary User:
The primary users would be large friend groups that often host intricate get togethers that involve
extensive planning and delegation. It could also be utilized for other event planning like club 
meetings, family events, or other hobbyist groups.
